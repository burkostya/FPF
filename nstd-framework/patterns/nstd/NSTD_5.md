## NSTD.5 - Engagement, Attention, and Motivation

> **Type:** DPF pattern body

> **Primary EntityOfConcern:** `NarrativeEngagementBoundary@Context`, a DPF-local boundary record for one narrative rendering.

### NSTD.5:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a narrative must be followed, remembered, cared about, or acted on, but engagement risks distorting source structure, persuasion boundary, ethical use, evidence use, assurance, or policy interpretation.

First useful move: state the intended engagement effect, the source structures that may not be distorted for that effect, and the non-admissible downstream use.

What goes wrong if missed: attention becomes confidence. Suspense, identification, emotional salience, fluency, and memorability make readers rely on the narrative beyond its source relation.

What this buys: engagement can be designed as support for declared use, not as an authority amplifier.

### NSTD.5:2 - Problem

Narratives often work because they attract attention and organize memory. That value is real. But the same mechanisms can overpersuade, hide uncertainty, simplify conflict, or make a reader treat a narrative as evidence, assurance, or permission.

### NSTD.5:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Attention vs source fidelity | Engagement can help readers reach source structure or distract from it. |
| Motivation vs manipulation | Motivation may be appropriate for teaching but unsafe for decisions or policy. |
| Memory vs overconfidence | Memorable stories can feel more certain than their sources. |
| Reader diversity vs one route | A motivating route for one group may mislead or harm another. |

### NSTD.5:4 - Solution

Record engagement as a bounded use support.

Admit engagement only when it serves the declared use and does not widen authority. If engagement depends on artistic, literary, dramatic, compressed, or simplified wording, name whether the live issue is a language-state profile (`C.2.LS`), controlled coarsening (`A.6.3.CSC`), explanation-facing rendering (`E.17.EFP`), or precision restoration (`E.10`, `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`). If engagement increases reliance pressure, route the stronger claim to ethics, evidence, assurance, gate, policy, or work owners.

Design engagement through a protected-structure loop.

1. Name the intended engagement effect: attention, curiosity, emotional salience, identification, suspense, memorability, motivation, or willingness to continue.
2. Name the protected source structures that may not be distorted to get that effect.
3. Choose the device: example, analogy, scene, viewpoint, contrast, unresolved tension, repetition, rhythm, visual image, or narrative hook.
4. State what the device is allowed to change: order, salience, language state, compression, repetition, or route.
5. State what it is not allowed to change: evidence strength, source truth, agency, responsibility, moral permission, policy authority, work authorization, or proof status.
6. Evaluate the result through `NSTD.6`, not through liking alone.

Use a reliance-pressure ladder.

| Reader reaction sought | Typical safe use | Extra owner needed if stronger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep reading | Orientation or teaching support | None unless source loss or manipulation risk appears. |
| Remember a structure | Learning or source-return support | `NSTD.6` reconstruction evidence; `NSTD.8` for learning route. |
| Care about a problem | Motivation for attention or inquiry | `D.1` through `D.5` if harm, affected parties, conflict, or decision pressure is live. |
| Trust a claim | Not owned by engagement | `A.10`, `B.3`, source owner, assurance owner. |
| Decide or act | Not owned by engagement | Decision, policy, ethics, work, or gate owner. |

Engagement can fail in two opposite ways. It may be too weak: readers do not stay with the material long enough to recover the source. It may be too strong: readers rely on the story past the source boundary. The repair is different. Low attention may need a better hook, example, rhythm, or viewpoint. Overreliance needs weaker claim language, source-return markers, affected-party routing, or lower admissible use.

When engagement uses artistic or literary language, do not reduce the issue to style preference. Ask which language-state facet changed: articulation, closure, anchoring, representation factor, threshold, compression, or cue. A more literary passage can be better for a memorial or exploratory essay and worse for a technical source-return task. The declared use and protected source structures decide.

### NSTD.5:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### Mature worked slice: engagement without persuasion capture

A learning narrative about FPF uses a dramatic failure story: a team blindly follows a pattern checklist and damages its project. The story is engaging, but it may over-persuade if it implies that FPF prevents all such failures or that the named team is evidence. `NSTD.5` keeps interest useful and bounded.

```text
NarrativeEngagementBoundary@FPFFailureStory:
  narrativeRenderingRef: FPFLearningRoute@v1
  engagementDevice: failed-use contrast with tension and repair
  protectedSourceStructureRefs:
    - pattern conditions
    - forces
    - neighboring exits
    - evaluation and improvement route
  intendedEffect: keep attention and make misuse recognizable
  persuasionOrHarmRisk: reader treats story as proof of FPF superiority or as blame of a real group
  sourceFidelityRisk: checklist failure hides the actual source relation being taught
  precisionBackoff: mark the story as an archetype and return to pattern body for authority
  evaluationReturn: `NSTD.6` checks reconstruction, not emotional agreement
```

Before:

> This disaster proves why teams must use FPF.

After:

> This fictionalized failure case shows one misuse: treating a pattern as a checklist after the governing situation has changed. It motivates attention, but the authority returns to the pattern body and the evidence or assurance claim would need its own owner.

#### Mature worked slice: homotopy interest without analogy capture

A homotopy lesson uses the image of a loop "slipping around a hole". The image is engaging and memorable, but it may cause learners to think all deformations are allowed. `NSTD.5` protects the formal boundary:

```text
NarrativeEngagementBoundary@HomotopyLoopImage:
  engagementDevice: vivid analogy
  protectedSourceStructureRefs: deformation under constraints, invariant, formal definition, proof-status boundary
  intendedEffect: sustain attention through abstraction
  persuasionOrHarmRisk: low, unless used to make a false certainty claim
  sourceFidelityRisk: analogy replaces condition-bound definition
  precisionBackoff: state where analogy stops and return to formal statement
  evaluationReturn: learner marks allowed and blocked deformation conditions
```

#### Engagement device selection matrix

| Device | Buys | Risk | Required repair handle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tension | Keeps attention across uncertainty. | Reads as evidence closure. | Name uncertainty and source return. |
| Failure story | Makes misuse vivid. | Becomes blame or proof by anecdote. | Mark archetype, evidence owner, and protected structure. |
| Analogy | Makes abstraction traversable. | Replaces definition or proof boundary. | State analogy stop condition. |
| Character viewpoint | Improves salience. | Imports agency or responsibility. | Use `NSTD.4` literalization repair. |
| Surprise reveal | Supports memory and curiosity. | Hides source constraints from worker as well as reader. | Return to `NSTD.1` and `NSTD.2` before composing. |
| Humor or style | Reduces attention cost. | Coarsens terms beyond later use. | Use `C.2.LS`, `A.6.3.CSC`, and `E.10` when claim-bearing. |

#### Calibration for engagement quality

| Value | Engagement condition |
| --- | --- |
| `2` | The narrative is interesting, but protected structures, persuasion risk, or precision backoff are not recoverable. |
| `3` | Engagement device and intended effect are named, but source-fidelity or harm repair is weak. |
| `4` | Engagement supports declared use while preserving source return, precision backoff, and ethics and evidence exits. |
| `5` | A low-engagement and high-engagement variant can be compared, and the high-engagement variant improves attention without lowering `NSTD.6` source recovery or owner routing. |

#### FPF owner teaching

`NSTD.5` is the pattern that prevents "make it interesting" from becoming a hidden ethics, evidence, or quality claim. FPF already distinguishes value, evidence, assurance, affected parties, language state, and quality terms. Narrative work does not override those distinctions; it adds a design concern: attention must be earned without capturing the source.

An explanation of FPF uses a story of a team fixing a broken pattern. The engagement effect is motivation and memory. Protected source structures are EntityOfConcern, forces, solution, checks, and source-return condition. The story may not be used as proof that the pattern works in all domains. Evaluation must check reconstruction, not only enjoyment.

A science-communication narrative may use tension around an unresolved experiment. The protected structures are the actual measurement, the attempted explanation, the uncertainty, and the boundary between "suggests" and "shows". If the story makes readers feel that the policy decision is settled, `NSTD.5` lowers the engagement design or routes policy and ethics claims to their owners.

A homotopy lesson may use a memorable image of stretching loops. The image is admissible only if learners can still recover definition boundaries and source-return points. If the image helps memory but makes learners treat all deformations as equivalent without conditions, repair source selection and event or model support before adding more vivid imagery.

A franchise continuation may use suspense, stakes, and identification. Those devices are useful when they protect attention to causal plot and character agency. They fail when fan-service or shock replaces continuity, source constraints, or agency support.

Live commentary may use excitement to keep listeners oriented. The protected structures are observed event, provisional inference, score state, and uncertainty. Engagement fails when suspense turns prediction into fact or blame into settled responsibility.

Choose engagement devices by protected structure, not by taste alone.

| Device | Good use | Failure mode | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hook | Creates initial attention for a source-returnable route. | Becomes clickbait or false problem statement. | Add source-return promise and blocked overread. |
| Tension | Keeps unresolved relation visible. | Converts uncertainty into dramatic certainty. | Name unresolved relation and evidence owner. |
| Identification | Helps readers track a role or viewpoint. | Turns sympathy into permission, blame, or policy. | Add affected-party and ethics routing. |
| Analogy | Makes abstract structure graspable. | Replaces definition or proof boundary. | State where analogy stops and source returns. |
| Repetition | Keeps source spine memorable. | Repeats slogan without reconstruction. | Pair each repeat with a reconstruction task. |
| Compression | Makes route usable under attention budget. | Drops distinctions needed for downstream use. | Use `A.6.3.CSC` or narrow admissible use. |
| Literary style | Supports felt sense, pacing, or atmosphere. | Becomes quality authority or source-authority signal. | Route language-state and evaluate declared-use quality. |

Do not remove engagement just because it is dangerous. Low engagement can make source recovery impossible because readers never stay with the route. The pattern's job is to bind engagement to a declared use, protected structure, and owner routing. A dry but unmemorable explanation can fail `NSTD.6` for learning use; a vivid but overpersuasive story can fail for evidence or ethics boundary. Both failures are real, but they have different repairs.

### NSTD.5:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern blocks engagement-authority drift: attention, identification, suspense, memorability, or motivation is treated as truth support, ethics clearance, assurance, policy permission, or work authorization. Repair by naming protected source structures, persuasion boundary, affected readers when live, and direct owners for stronger claims. Scope: DPF-local for engagement in narrative renderings; it does not govern all persuasion or ethics work.

### NSTD.5:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-NSTD5-1` | Engagement effect is named as use support. |
| `CC-NSTD5-2` | Protected source structures are named. |
| `CC-NSTD5-3` | Persuasion, policy, work, evidence, ethics, and assurance use boundaries are explicit when live. |
| `CC-NSTD5-4` | Affected readers, listeners, or groups are named when harm or manipulation risk is live. |
| `CC-NSTD5-5` | Low engagement does not automatically fail declared-use rendering quality; low source recovery does fail source-recovery quality when source recovery is required. |
| `CC-NSTD5-6` | Artistic, literary, dramatic, simplified, or memorable wording is routed to language-state, coarsening, explanation, or precision owners when it changes source recovery, authority, or declared use. |

### NSTD.5:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fluency as truth | Smooth narrative is treated as supported claim. | Route evidence to `A.10` and evaluate source recovery in `NSTD.6`. |
| Identification as permission | Readers identify with a protagonist and infer what they should do. | Add persuasion boundary and route policy or work claims to owners. |
| Artisticness as adequacy | More literary or memorable wording is treated as a better narrative regardless of lost structure. | State the language-state or engagement choice, then evaluate source recovery and source return through `NSTD.6`; use `A.6.3.CSC` if distinctions were deliberately dropped. |
| Engagement-only success | Readers liked it but cannot reconstruct source structure. | Add reconstruction task and repair via `NSTD.1` through `NSTD.3`. |

### NSTD.5:9 - Consequences

The benefit is safer narrative power: attention is used without stealing evidence or ethics authority. The cost is that designers must state when engagement is not enough.

### NSTD.5:10 - Rationale

The best narrative practice does not reject engagement. It disciplines engagement by purpose, audience, source fidelity, and ethical boundary. FPF makes those boundaries explicit and owner-routed.

### NSTD.5:11 - SoTA-Echoing

Green and Brock's "The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narratives" treats transportation as a persuasion-relevant effect; Dahlstrom and Ho's "Ethical Considerations of Using Narrative to Communicate Science" makes accuracy loss, policy influence, and affected readers visible; Mengelkamp et al.'s "Effects of Reading Goal Instructions on the Comprehension and Metacomprehension of Informative Narratives" shows engagement and metacomprehension can mislead without explicit goals; Georgiou et al.'s "Large-scale study of human memory for meaningful narratives" warns that memory can preserve summary and order while losing source detail. The DPF adopts engagement as a design characteristic but routes persuasion, harm, bias, evidence, and assurance through FPF owners.

Operational payload:

- From transportation research, engagement can change persuasion. `NSTD.5` therefore treats engagement as a power, not as decoration.
- From science-communication ethics, narrative can change accuracy, policy interpretation, and perceived obligation. The pattern therefore requires non-admissible downstream use and affected-reader routing when live.
- From reading-goal research, explicit goals matter. A narrative that works for motivation may fail for comprehension, and a narrative that feels understood may increase overconfidence.
- From memory research, long narratives can preserve gist and sequence while losing source detail. `NSTD.5` therefore protects source structures and sends learning cases to reconstruction tasks.
- From FPF language-state and coarsening patterns, literary, compressed, or memorable wording is a change in representation, not an automatic quality increase.

The practical consequence is that engagement is evaluated by its service to declared use and protected structure. It is not a moral permission slip, evidence boost, or universal quality value.

### NSTD.5:12 - Relations

Uses `A.6.3.NAR`, `NSTD.1`, `NSTD.3`, `NSTD.6`, `C.2.LS`, `A.6.3.CSC`, `E.17.EFP`, `E.10`, `A.6.P`, `C.16.Q`, `D.1` through `D.5`, `A.10`, `B.3`, `E.17`, and `G.11`. Reopen when reader telemetry, harm assessment, source fidelity, language-state profile, coarsening relation, precision repair, or persuasion boundary changes. Support-map entry: open `Semiotic And Language-Precision Bridge` when interesting, literary, artistic, memorable, hook, cue, coarsening, or explanation language becomes load-bearing; open `DPF Precision Restoration And Owner Map` when engagement, adequacy, quality, value, or persuasion terms overload; open `Source Use And Refresh Map` when persuasion, memory, cognition, or ethics source claims carry the boundary.
