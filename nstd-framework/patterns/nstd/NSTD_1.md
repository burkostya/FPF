## NSTD.1 - Source-Structure Intake and Narrative Purpose

> **Type:** DPF pattern body

> **Primary EntityOfConcern:** `NarrativePurposeIntake@Context`, a DPF-local relation record for one narrative rendering case.

### NSTD.1:1 - Problem frame

Use this pattern when a writer, narrator, teacher, architect, researcher, commentator, story designer, or tool starts with a message, lesson, theme, persuasive effect, desired memory, live commentary line, or future scenario before naming the source structures that must survive the narrative rendering.

First useful move: write `NarrativePurposeIntake@Context` with source material, selected source structures, source-structure selection rationale, source temporal posture, route family, narrating or rendering worker, reader-interest or use hypothesis, intended reader or listener role and use, narrative purpose, blocked purpose overread, source-return owner, and any ethics or assurance owner.

What goes wrong if missed: purpose absorbs source. The narrative may become memorable, but readers cannot recover which structure was selected, which uncertainty was retained, or which claims need source return.

What this buys: the writer can choose a narrative aim without letting that aim widen evidence, assurance, ethics, policy, or work authority.

Not this pattern when the issue is only publication face, source-pack admission, evidence sufficiency, or ethics mediation. Use the direct owner and return here only when narrative purpose must be tied to selected source structure.

### NSTD.1:2 - Problem

Narrative purpose is useful because a narrative rendering is made for someone and for some use. But ordinary purpose language is often too broad: "make it inspiring", "tell the story", "explain the architecture", "make learners care". Those phrases do not say which structures must be preserved, which distinctions may be coarsened, and which downstream use is blocked.

### NSTD.1:3 - Forces

| Force | Tension |
| --- | --- |
| Reader usefulness vs source discipline | A narrative needs a purpose, but the purpose cannot replace selected source structures. |
| Motivation vs authority | Motivation helps attention, but it does not create evidence, assurance, ethics clearance, or work permission. |
| Domain vocabulary vs FPF owners | Narratology and communication terms help design, but source, evidence, ethics, and assurance claims have FPF owners. |
| Writing speed vs replayability | Fast writing starts from message; replayable writing starts from source structure and use. |

### NSTD.1:4 - Solution

Create one intake record before drafting or evaluating the narrative.

```text
NarrativePurposeIntake@Context:
  sourceMaterialRef:
  selectedSourceStructureRefs:
  sourceStructureSelectionRationale:
  sourceTemporalPosture:
  routeFamily: direct-source-structure | architecture-mediated | mixed
  architectureMediationRef?:
  sourceStructureOwnerRef?:
  narratingOrRenderingWorkerRef?:
  readerOrListenerRoleRefs:
  readerInterestOrUseHypothesis:
  intendedReaderOrListenerUse:
  narrativePurpose:
  blockedPurposeOverread:
  sourceReturnOwner:
  ethicsOrAssuranceOwner?:
  refreshCondition?:
```

Then apply these moves:

1. Name source material, selected source structures, source-structure selection rationale, and source temporal posture.
2. Name the route family and any architecture mediation, source-structure owner, or telemetry source that remains live.
3. Name the narrating or rendering worker, reader-interest or use hypothesis, and intended reader or listener role and use in project terms.
4. State the narrative purpose as a relation to the selected source structures and reader or listener use.
5. State what the purpose may not justify: evidence, assurance, policy, work, ethics, or decision use.
6. Name the source-return owner and any neighboring FPF owner.

Use the intake in four passes, not as one form-filling gesture.

| Pass | Question | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source pass | What source-bearing material is being rendered, and which structures must remain recoverable for the declared use? | Source material refs, selected structure refs, and source owner refs. |
| Use pass | Who will use the narrative, for what work or understanding, and what must they be able to recover or decide not to decide? | Reader or listener role, reader-interest hypothesis, intended use, and non-use boundary. |
| Route pass | Is the work direct source-structure rendering, architecture-mediated rendering, or mixed? What temporal posture changes source obligations? | Route family, temporal posture, architecture mediation refs, and live telemetry or source-return refs. |
| Authority pass | Which claims are tempting but not granted by the narrative purpose? | Blocked purpose overread plus evidence, assurance, ethics, policy, work, and decision owner exits. |

The intake is good enough to compose only when the selected source structures can be stated without looking at the current prose version. If the only answer is "the important bits are the bits I happened to write about", selection is still hidden. Return to the source material, name candidate structures, and choose by reader use. If the reader use is also vague, stop at an orientation cue or source-pack note; do not present the carrier-borne content as an admitted narrative rendering.

Use contrast cases before drafting:

- Admissible: "This route helps new FPF readers reconstruct why `EntityOfConcern`, forces, and neighboring-pattern exits matter during pattern use." The selected structures are named and the use is reconstructive.
- Below floor: "Make the seminar inspiring so people like FPF." Motivation is a possible engagement device, but source structures and reconstruction use are missing.
- Wrong owner: "Use the narrative to prove FPF is correct." That is evidence or assurance work, not narrative-purpose work.

For prospective or fictional material, the selected source structure may be a constrained source pack rather than already-realized facts. The intake must still name the canon, scenario assumptions, design constraints, or future-state hypotheses that count as source-bearing for the case. "The story world wants it" is not a source-structure selection rationale; the worker must state which admitted source constraints make the narrative route legitimate for private planning, teaching, or scenario exploration.

Use role-specific intake prompts when the worker is stuck.

| Worker situation | Prompt | Expected answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Teacher or trainer | "After the narrative, what should learners reconstruct from source without relying on my story?" | Source spine, reconstruction task, and source-return condition. |
| Architect or analyst | "Which structure, trade-off, candidate, telemetry, or decision memory must survive the narrative?" | Architecture or source-structure refs plus route family. |
| Scientist or researcher | "Which mechanism, calculation, failed attempt, source uncertainty, or unresolved tension is being rendered?" | Mechanism or event support, uncertainty, evidence owner, and source return. |
| Story designer | "Which canon, premise, agency, continuity, or causal plot constraint is source-bearing for this route?" | Bounded source pack and non-publication boundary when needed. |
| Live commentator | "Which observation, inference, prediction, and later official source must stay distinguishable?" | Temporal posture, uncertainty markers, and refresh condition. |
| Tool builder | "Which part is source, which part is method, which part is generated carrier, and who admits it?" | Split between source, method, generated carrier, and admission owner; generated-carrier admission route; human responsibility. |

If the answer names only mood, audience reaction, style, genre, or desired conclusion, the intake is not ready. Those can be legitimate later choices under `NSTD.4`, `NSTD.5`, `C.2.LS`, or `E.17`, but they cannot select the source structure by themselves.

### NSTD.1:5 - Archetypal Grounding

#### Mature worked slice: FPF seminar from source spine to admitted route

Start with a weak request: "Tell a motivating story about FPF so people want to use it." This is not yet a narrative purpose intake. The source structure is hidden, the reader use is vague, and motivation is being asked to carry adoption, evidence, and teaching value at once.

Repair it in the intake, not later in style.

```text
NarrativePurposeIntake@FPFSeminarOrientation:
  sourceMaterialRef: selected FPF pattern bodies and relation records
  selectedSourceStructureRefs:
    - EntityOfConcern discipline
    - Problem frame and forces
    - Solution as admissible move under conditions
    - neighboring-pattern exits
    - quality and improvement loop entry
  sourceStructureSelectionRationale: new practitioners fail when they treat patterns as recipes rather than condition-bound moves
  sourceTemporalPosture: prospective planned learning route over current FPF source corpus
  routeFamily: direct-source-structure
  narratingOrRenderingWorkerRef: seminar author
  readerOrListenerRoleRefs: new FPF practitioner; team lead evaluating local adoption
  readerInterestOrUseHypothesis: reader wants a first usable route through FPF without learning every pattern first
  intendedReaderOrListenerUse: reconstruct one pattern-use route and choose the next governing pattern
  narrativePurpose: orient attention and motivation toward source-returnable pattern use
  blockedPurposeOverread: not proof that FPF is correct; not replacement for pattern bodies; not authority for a local project
  sourceReturnOwner: selected FPF pattern body and relation record
  ethicsOrAssuranceOwner: none unless the seminar makes assurance, policy, or affected-party claims
  refreshCondition: FPF edition or selected-source pattern changes; learner reconstruction test fails
```

Now the narrative worker can compose. The first paragraph may be memorable, but every memorable move has a source return. "A pattern is not a recipe" returns to source conditions, forces, and neighboring exits. "Start with the thing being changed" returns to `EntityOfConcern`. "Do not optimize the visible proxy indicator" returns to quality and proxy-risk owners. The seminar publication carrier can be engaging, but the intake prevents it from becoming a local mythology about FPF.

Evaluation through `NSTD.6` later asks whether learners can rebuild the route: identify the source structure, say why the selected order was didactic, name what the story intentionally omitted, and return to the pattern body when they need authority. If learners only repeat the slogan "patterns are not recipes", `NSTD.1` did not select enough source structure for the declared use.

#### Mature worked slice: architecture-mediated narrative

An architect wants a narrative explaining a system's future structure after candidate synthesis. Do not start with "tell the journey from chaos to architecture". Start by deciding whether the narrative is architecture-mediated. If it is, architecture work remains live before narrative work.

```text
NarrativePurposeIntake@ArchitectureDecisionStory:
  sourceMaterialRef: architecture candidate set, selected architecture description, decision record, expected characteristics, known residuals
  selectedSourceStructureRefs:
    - problem situation and forces
    - candidate structures considered
    - selected structure and rejected alternatives
    - expected architecture characteristics
    - residual exceptions and developer continuation boundary
    - telemetry or later actual-structure feedback condition
  sourceTemporalPosture: prospective future holon structure before implementation
  routeFamily: architecture-mediated
  architectureMediationRef: architecture description and candidate synthesis records
  readerOrListenerRoleRefs: developer team; product steward; later evaluator
  intendedReaderOrListenerUse: understand what structure to preserve while implementing and what may be locally detailed
  narrativePurpose: carry structural intent and trade-off rationale into development work
  blockedPurposeOverread: not the architecture itself; not implementation order; not assurance that realized structure will match
  sourceReturnOwner: architecture description, architecture decision record, and future telemetry route
  refreshCondition: candidate set, selected architecture, decision, or actual-structure feedback changes
```

This case teaches the architecture bridge. The narrative worker is not exempt from architecture owners just because the output is prose. `C.33` is live for structural-information capture and loss; `C.34` is live if correspondence between described and realized structure matters; `E.17` is live if the carrier is published; architecture decision owners remain live for decision authority. `NSTD.1` only binds the narrative purpose to selected structures and reader use.

#### Mature worked slice: franchise continuation probe

For a continuation-style storycraft probe using a well-known space-opera franchise such as `Star Wars`, the selected source is a bounded private source pack. The intake must state canon scope, character-agency constraints, continuity constraints, premise constraints, and non-publication boundary before any scene or plot move is accepted.

A bad intake says: "Write a surprising sequel that feels epic." A repaired intake says: "For private storycraft testing, render a continuation premise that preserves admitted canon constraints, character agency, causal consequence, and theme tension; block publication, rights, and authority claims." If a surprising turn works only because the source pack was ignored, the failure belongs to `NSTD.1` before `NSTD.2` or `NSTD.5` can repair it.

#### Role-specific mature first moves

| Worker | First source-selection move | Common hidden overread | Repair before composing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Teacher | Name the source spine and reconstruction task. | Learner interest means learning occurred. | Add source-return question and later `NSTD.6` row. |
| Architect | Name selected structures, candidates, residuals, and actual-structure feedback. | Explanatory story is the architecture decision. | Route decision authority to architecture decision owners. |
| Scientist | Name mechanism, calculation, uncertainty, and proof or evidence boundary. | Story coherence is evidence closure. | Add evidence owner and source-return condition. |
| Story designer | Name source pack, continuity, agency, and non-use boundary. | Dramatic surprise authorizes source violation. | Reopen source-pack selection before ordering. |
| Live commentator | Name event stream, provisional interpretation, and later official return. | Live causal claim is settled fact. | Mark uncertainty and telemetry return. |
| AI-agent operator | Name source plan, schema, admission owner, and evaluation route. | Fluent generated prose is an admitted rendering. | Send carrier to `NSTD.7` and `C.35` before `NSTD.6`. |

#### What this pattern teaches about FPF

`NSTD.1` is often the first place where a narrative worker learns why FPF separates source, description, evidence, assurance, ethics, publication, and improvement. The pattern does not ask for more paperwork. It asks the worker to stop one very common collapse: "I have a purpose, therefore I know what the story should say." In FPF terms, a purpose is a relation to an `EntityOfConcern`, a role use, and selected source structures. It is not the source, not the authority, and not the quality result.

An FPF seminar route wants learners to understand why pattern use is condition-based rather than recipe following. The selected source structures are `EntityOfConcern`, problem frame, forces, solution, consequences, and neighboring-pattern exits. The purpose is orientation for later reconstruction tasks. It is not permission to replace pattern bodies with seminar slogans. Source return points to the FPF patterns and the seminar publication carrier stays outside this DPF body.

A homotopy explanation starts differently. The source material is a mathematical corpus: definitions, examples, maps, equivalences, proof-status boundaries, and formal sources. The intended reader is not "any curious person"; it might be an undergraduate who must later distinguish intuitive pictures from formal definitions. The purpose can be "make paths, deformations, and invariants followable", but the blocked overread says that the narrative does not prove the theorem, replace formal notation, or license analogy as definition. The intake therefore protects formal return before any metaphor is selected.

A live football commentary has a live unfolding source posture. The commentator's purpose may be orientation and suspense, but the selected structures are event order, score state, possession changes, player actions, provisional interpretation, and later official source return. The intake blocks the overread that a dramatic prediction, blame cue, or emotional framing is evidence. If later official statistics contradict the live interpretation, the refresh condition is not optional.

A franchise-continuation storycraft test uses a prospective fictional source posture. The source structures are admitted canon constraints, continuity requirements, premise constraints, character-agency constraints, and non-publication boundary. The purpose may be private storycraft testing, not authorized sequel publication. The intake must state that publication rights, exhaustive canon authority, and moral permission are outside this DPF case.

### NSTD.1:6 - Bias-Annotation

This pattern blocks purpose-primacy drift: the message, theme, desired memory, or persuasion effect is allowed to choose source structures after the fact. Treating purpose as the source-selection owner collapses selected source structure, reader use, and authority boundary. Repair by reopening the intake, naming selected structures, and writing the blocked purpose overread before drafting or evaluating. Scope: DPF-local for narrative renderings; it does not govern all communication, evidence, assurance, or publication work.

### NSTD.1:7 - Conformance Checklist

| Check | Passing condition |
| --- | --- |
| `CC-NSTD1-1` | Source material and selected source structures are named before purpose is finalized. |
| `CC-NSTD1-2` | Source-structure selection rationale explains why these structures are needed for the reader or listener use. |
| `CC-NSTD1-3` | Source temporal posture and route family are explicit. |
| `CC-NSTD1-4` | Narrating or rendering worker, reader-interest or use hypothesis, and intended reader or listener role are named. |
| `CC-NSTD1-5` | Intended use is narrower than general persuasion, inspiration, or entertainment. |
| `CC-NSTD1-6` | Purpose states non-admissible downstream use. |
| `CC-NSTD1-7` | Evidence, assurance, ethics, policy, and work claims route to direct owners when made. |
| `CC-NSTD1-8` | Source-return owner and refresh condition are present when source currentness or hidden distinctions matter. |

### NSTD.1:8 - Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

| Anti-pattern | What fails | Repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message-first drafting | The theme chooses the structure after the fact. | Reopen intake and name selected source structures before drafting. |
| Tacit selection as craft | The worker or model foregrounds structures, but no rationale ties them to reader use. | Reconstruct the selection rationale and reader-interest hypothesis before evaluating or improving the narrative. |
| Motivation as truth support | A moving narrative is treated as stronger evidence. | Route evidence to `A.10` and keep motivation as reader-use support. |
| Purpose without blocked use | The same narrative is reused for decision, policy, or work. | Add blocked purpose overread and source-return condition. |

### NSTD.1:9 - Consequences

The benefit is early kind stability: source material, selected structure, narrative rendering, reader use, and authority boundaries stop competing. The cost is one small intake record before drafting.

### NSTD.1:10 - Rationale

Narrative design traditions often begin with audience and communicative aim. FPF keeps that value, but it binds aim to selected source structure. This avoids semio-bias: the narrative is a rendering relation over source structure, not a free-standing communication product.

### NSTD.1:11 - SoTA-Echoing

#### Operational comparison against domain vocabulary

This DPF intentionally translates domain vocabulary into FPF owner work instead of importing it whole. When narratology says story, discourse, and presentation, this package asks: what source structure is selected, what order is chosen, what is foregrounded, and what source return remains? When cognitive narratology says event model, transportation, perspective, or memory, this package asks: which reconstruction target, engagement device, viewpoint, or evaluation characteristic is being changed? When NLG says content planning, discourse planning, and realization, this package asks: what is the source plan, what is the ordering rule, what is the generated carrier, and what admission and evaluation route owns it?

The practical consequence is a repair rule. If a domain term helps the worker choose or repair a narrative move, keep it as DPF vocabulary. If it starts carrying evidence, assurance, ethics, agency, publication, or Core ontology, route the claim to the FPF owner and state the blocked overread.

Hoffmann's "The Tensions of Scientific Storytelling" shows that scientific story construction can organize attempts, mechanisms, and unresolved tensions for readers; Schmid's `Narratology: An Introduction` and Chihaia's `Introductions to Narratology: Theory, Practice and the Afterlife of Structuralism` show that presentation and audience-facing narrative traditions differ by source tradition; Castricato et al.'s "Towards a Formal Model of Narratives" supports explicit narrator-to-reader information flow, reader story-model evolution, and uncertainty; Dahlstrom and Ho's "Ethical Considerations of Using Narrative to Communicate Science" warns that communicative purpose can become persuasion risk. The DPF adapts audience and purpose only after source-structure selection, temporal posture, route family, and role split are named. When a purpose, reader-use, science-storytelling, teaching, future-scenario, or persuasion-risk claim depends on a source line, name that source line and keep the claim within its boundary.

### NSTD.1:12 - Relations

Uses `A.6.3.NAR` for Core relation ownership, `A.16.1` when the first honest material is only a pre-articulation narrative cue, `C.2.LS` when language-state facets or thresholds shape the intake, `G.2` for source-pack claims, `C.33` when architecture-relevant structural-information capture or loss is current, `NSTD.6` when non-architecture narrative epiplexity is evaluated, `D.1` through `D.5` when affected parties or persuasion are live, `A.10` for evidence, `B.3` for assurance, `E.10` and `F.18` for durable wording or naming repairs, and `G.11` for source and telemetry refresh. Support-map entry: open `Architecture and Narrative Work Bridge` when `routeFamily` is `architecture-mediated` or `mixed`; open `Source Use And Refresh Map` when a source line is relied on or stale; open `DPF Precision Restoration And Owner Map` when a local narrative term threatens to become ontology; open `Name And Edition Route` only for DPF-prefix or edition questions.
